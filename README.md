        <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am Joel Metzger, a passionate computer science student at the University of Michigan. I am constantly learning and applying my knowledge to real-world projects. The classes that I am currently enrolled in are EECS 492 and EECS 440.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Character Animation Integration</h3>
            <p>This project focuses on integrating character animations into a game environment, including converting a Skeletal Mesh Actor to a Static Mesh and adding a walking animation. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>NPC Interaction and 3D Dialogue System</h3>
            <p>I implemented unique NPC interactions, where characters look towards the player and hop when nearby. Upon interaction, 3D text-based dialogue cycles through a series of lines, orienting towards the player for visibility.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Fire Alarm System with State-Based Audio and Light Control</h3>
            <p>Developed a fire alarm system with two states. In the 'active' state, the alarm triggers red flashing lights and plays audio. In the 'idle' state, lights return to normal, and the alarm sound ceases gradually.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Ceiling Lights</h3>
            <p>I added ceiling lights to the lab and then had to change the shadows that way they wouldn't overlap and there were no difficulties building the lighting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Blockout Basic Area Structure</h3>
            <p>This was my favorite part of the project, I really enjoyed blocking out the structure of the lab and designing its archtecture from scratch. Overall I enjoyed the actors more than I did the interaction or coding, mainly because it was more artistic in my opinion.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Windows</h3>
            <p>Using different material meshes in a wall to create windows in the wall of the lab as well as the ability to see the passerby actor walking around the building.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>CSE Simulation: Object Interaction</h3>
            <p>Expanded a CSE simulation by introducing interactive soda cans and other new object types. Additionally, the simulation includes time-of-day transitions that occur when interacting with objects in the lab.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am Joel Metzger, a passionate computer science student at the University of Michigan. I am constantly learning and applying my knowledge to real-world projects. The classes that I am currently enrolled in are EECS 492 and EECS 440.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">EECS 440 Project 1</h2>

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tukbZ_JUiMY" target="_blank">Watch the project demo video</a>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Character Animation Integration</h3>
            <p>This project focuses on integrating character animations into a game environment, including converting a Skeletal Mesh Actor to a Static Mesh and adding a walking animation. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>NPC Interaction and 3D Dialogue System</h3>
            <p>I implemented unique NPC interactions, where characters look towards the player and hop when nearby. Upon interaction, 3D text-based dialogue cycles through a series of lines, orienting towards the player for visibility.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Fire Alarm System with State-Based Audio and Light Control</h3>
            <p>Developed a fire alarm system with two states. In the 'active' state, the alarm triggers red flashing lights and plays audio. In the 'idle' state, lights return to normal, and the alarm sound ceases gradually.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Ceiling Lights</h3>
            <p>I added ceiling lights to the lab and then had to change the shadows that way they wouldn't overlap and there were no difficulties building the lighting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Blockout Basic Area Structure</h3>
            <p>This was my favorite part of the project, I really enjoyed blocking out the structure of the lab and designing its architecture from scratch. Overall I enjoyed the actors more than I did the interaction or coding, mainly because it was more artistic in my opinion.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Windows</h3>
            <p>Using different material meshes in a wall to create windows in the wall of the lab as well as the ability to see the passerby actor walking around the building.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>CSE Simulation: Object Interaction</h3>
            <p>Expanded a CSE simulation by introducing interactive soda cans and other new object types. Additionally, the simulation includes time-of-day transitions that occur when interacting with objects in the lab.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="section-title">EECS 440 Project 2</h2>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>UI: Landmark Discovery</h3>
            <p>When the player discovers a new landmark while walking around Ann Arbor, a pop-up provides historical insights and unlocks a new seed type as a reward. This encourages exploration and adds educational value to gameplay.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Game Object: Squirrel</h3>
            <p>Ann Arbor's famously well-fed squirrels add drama and tension to the game by occasionally interfering with the player’s planted trees, serving as playful antagonists.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>UI: Inventory Bar</h3>
            <p>An ever-present, scrollable inventory bar sits at the bottom of the app, displaying buttons for each seed type (and potentially acorns). Each button shows the quantity of that seed type available, enhancing user interaction with seed resources.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>App Overview</h3>
            <p>This project is an AR app inspired by Pokémon Go, where players plant trees and collect seeds around Ann Arbor. However, players must watch out for squirrels that attempt to disrupt planting efforts, adding a unique challenge to the experience.</p>
